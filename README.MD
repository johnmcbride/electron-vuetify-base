# Electron/Vuetify base project starter

## Introduction

This is a starter project for an [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) and [vuetify](https://electronjs.org/) based project. It uses [electron-webpack](https://webpack.electron.build/) as the webpack compilation system so it is very lightweight as a starter project.

## Components Used

- electron
- vue
- electron-webpack
- vuetify
- electron-webpack-vue
- webpack

## Notes

- electron-webpack will auto generate a main index.html file. If you would like to customize your own, you will have to create your own webpack config file/function and add the html plugin

- We use the vuetify-loader plugin to compile all the vuetify components. Since we do this there is a customer webpack config file located in the webpack folder.

- Since this is a boilerplate project, there is a components folder that you can use to put your vue based Single file components into.
